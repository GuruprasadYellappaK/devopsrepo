## Abstracts

### Workshop

In this workshop, you will learn how to setup and configure continuous delivery within Github. You will do this through the use of a new Azure DevOps project, Github repository for source control, Github actions for continuous delivery and deployment automation, and an Azure Resource Manager template for Azure resource deployment and configuration management.

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition,  you'll create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to provision Azure resources, configure continuous delivery with Azure DevOps, and create an Azure DevOps project and Git repository.


### Whiteboard design session *(this will go in the readme and in the WDS document)*
In this whiteboard design session, you will learn how to design a solution with a combination of Azure Resource Manager templates, Azure DevOps, and Github actions to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to build templates to automate cloud infrastructure and reduce error-prone manual processes. In addition, you'll learn how to design a deployment and monitoring architecture using Azure Resource Manager templates to provision Azure resources, Application Insights for deep application monitoring, and Github as a source code repository and build/deploy pipeline.


### Hands-on lab *(this will go in the readme and in the HOL document)*
In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to implement a solution with a combination of Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure DevOps to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions for continuous delivery with Github in Azure, as well create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to provision Azure resources, create an Azure DevOps project with a Github repository, and configure continuous delivery with Github.
